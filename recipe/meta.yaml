  summary: 'Wrapper around isl, an integer set library'

  description: |

    islpy is a Python wrapper around Sven Verdoolaege's
    [isl](http://www.kotnet.org/~skimo/isl/), a library for manipulating
    sets and relations of integer points bounded by linear constraints.

    Supported operations on sets include

    -   intersection, union, set difference,
    -   emptiness check,
    -   convex hull,
    -   (integer) affine hull,
    -   integer projection,
    -   computing the lexicographic minimum using parametric integer
        programming,
    -   coalescing, and
    -   parametric vertex enumeration.

    It also includes an ILP solver based on generalized basis reduction,
    transitive closures on maps (which may encode infinite graphs),
    dependence analysis and bounds on piecewise step-polynomials.
